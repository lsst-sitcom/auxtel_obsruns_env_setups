This repo is a common space to house environment setup scripts for AuxTel runs. This is meant to be a temporary space until we get a proper environment handling system in place.

To use, first run the setup shell script that will download the required packages and checkout the correct branch using:

bash bash/lsst/sitcom/package_setup-obsrun-2021-03-22.sh 

Then, open the Verification_notebook.ipynb, located in the same directory as this README, and run the cells making sure to use the same name as the script as used above.
